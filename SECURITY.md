## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue.
2. Prefer a **private report** via GitHub Security Advisories (if enabled for this repository).
3. If advisories aren’t available, email the maintainer (repo owner) with:
   - A clear description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Impact and suggested fix (if you have one)

We’ll acknowledge receipt and work on a fix as quickly as possible.
